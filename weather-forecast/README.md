### code challenge

The challenge is to build a simple weather forecast web app for the user's current location. Weather data is provided by the OpenWeather API. The documentation for the API is here: 

https://openweathermap.org/api. 

The docs include all of the information you should need to get API keys and access the appropriate API endpoints to access the data you need. It is up to you to choose which of the APIs to use. If you need to use an API key to use a service, please use the key below:

`5f27e6de016a45e5d58cf3cf874bd3be`

The app should display the weather forecast for the next 5 days for the user's location. The weather data should be displayed in a human readable format and include appropriate icons for the forecasted weather type.

The current day's weather should be the most prominent, and display all of the data that a user would want to know about the weather. You do not have to display all of the data elements that are provided by the API, just the one's that you would like to display in your weather app.

The following 4 days should display a summary of the forecast weather data. When a user clicks on the weather forecast for any of the following days you need to display more detailed data for that day.

The app must be responsive so that it displays nicely on both desktop and mobile clients and as mentioned if you could use Vue.js that would be great.
